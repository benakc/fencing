We want to evaluate win percentages at the highest levels of competition. Do not delete or overwrite any existing scrapers, analysis, or results. Instead, create new scraper and analysis file based on the existing scraper.py and analysis.py files and write them to the Analysis Part 2 folder.
For the scraper, scrape only the existing cached users that registered for the Div I aka Division 1 events at 2024 Nationals and look at all other 2024 NAC or Summer nationals tournaments Div 1 events. For all their opponents in the NAC/Summer nationals tournaments and Div 1 event, gather key metadata like tournament name, event name and date, name, gender, and weapon as well as initial seed vs. final placement. We need to make sure that these tournament placements are deduplicated across fencers. 
Our goal is to try to predict final placement based on initial seed for these NAC and National Championship events and segment the analysis by gender and weapon to see if results for some weapons are more predictable than for others.
