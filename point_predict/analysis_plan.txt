Pull the data from fencingworldwide (example case here https://www.fencingworldwide.com/en/6436-2025/direct/3#match-B-2 ) with data on the bout level that includes all of the point by point progression of the bouts. 
First, let's predict the likelihood of victory based on the initial tournament seed in the direct elimination matches. Are 1 seeds likely to defeat 100 seeds? By how much? Does it differ by fencing weapon?
Use the data to create a multivariant predictive model separated by fencing weapon and gender for all 2025 international senior World Cup, Grand Prix, and the world championship in order to predict the likelihood of a victory given a certain score at a certain time and about. 
To start, just scrape all of the bouts from this specific event and cache the results, if needed.
Start with just a predictive model of what is the likelihood of a victory for a given set of scores i.e. what if Fencer is winning 14 to 10 what would their likelihood of victory be in that bout given foil given they're fencing foil, epee, or saber. I’m particularly interested in how much a lead is worth. So if a fencer is up by two touches in epee for example, do they have a greater likelihood of victory versus if they have if they are fencing saber. We can find a baseline level of likelihood of victory by taking into account their initial seeds going into the tournament and considering that as an additional variable. Are epee tournaments actually more volatile and result in less consistent results than foil and Saber.
