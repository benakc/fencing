- Fencer 1 is always the fencer whose history page the bout was extracted from
- Winner=1 means fencer_1 won (they had result "V"), Winner=2 means fencer_2 won
- ELO values reflect the fencer's overall pool/DE strength, not bout-specific
- Gender is not explicitly available; "Senior Mixed" events include all genders
- Rating letters: A (highest) > B > C > D > E > U (unrated)
- The number after the rating letter is the year it was earned (e.g. A25 = A rating, 2025)
