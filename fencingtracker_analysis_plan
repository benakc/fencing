I want to analyze the relative performance of competitors in fencing. An example question I want to be able to answer is "what is the win rate of a B-rated men's epee fencer against an A-rated women's epee fencer?"
Here is my plan to address these questions:
1) Pull data for 10 fencingtracker.com tournaments that took place in January 2026 by creating a python scraper and storing the tournament data as a CSV in the Claude_project directory.
2) Enrich this event-level data using data from each fencer's history page on fencingtracker to provide information on a bout level. For each bout, we want to know who won, what kind of bout took place (pool or direct elimination), what the gender of each fencer was, what weapon was fenced, the rating of each fencer, and the ELO of each fencer.
3) Store the bout-level data in a CSV in the same directory.
4) Summarize the data. How many events took place and across which weapons? How many fencers participated? What was the rating distribution of the fencers? How many bouts took place between men, between women, and were mixed-gender bouts? And similar questions.
5) Create cross tabs that illustrate the percentage of wins for a given weapon for a given letter rating against all of the other letter ratings. Produce three tabs for each weapon, one being men vs men, one being women vs women and one being a mixed-gender bout. Provide a second set of charts that summarize the ELO versus ELO win rates, i.e. "what is the chance that someone with a 2300 ELO in saber beats someone with a 3000 ELO in saber" and make the charts conditional on gender, as well.
