Analysis Part 2: Seed vs. Placement — Key Findings Discussion
=============================================================
Dataset: 4,791 observations, 2,235 unique fencers, 24 events across 4 tournaments
(3 NACs + Summer Nationals, Div I only, 2024)

Expanded dataset includes opponent seed/placement data extracted from bout tables,
more than doubling fencer coverage from the original 1,053 cached population.

CORRELATIONS
------------
Overall Spearman r = 0.741 — seeds are meaningfully predictive of placement.

Predictability ranking by weapon:
  Foil:  r=0.763 — most predictable
  Epee:  r=0.736
  Saber: r=0.700 — least predictable

Gender differences are modest:
  M: r=0.736 (n=2914)
  F: r=0.696 (n=1877)

REGRESSION
----------
OLS on log(placement) ~ log(seed) + weapon + gender + interactions:
  Overall R-squared: 0.552
  Seed coefficient: 0.72 (highly significant)
  Saber and gender_F terms are significant; weapon:gender interactions are not.

Per-slice R-squared:
  Highest: foil F (R2=0.568)
  Lowest:  epee F (R2=0.484)

UPSET DISTANCE (place - seed)
-----------------------------
Epee has the most volatile outcomes (SD=69.2), especially men's epee (SD=80.1).
Foil (SD=49.5) and saber (SD=46.5) are substantially less volatile.
Levene's test confirms significantly different volatility across weapons (p<0.0001).

Men's events are more volatile than women's across all weapons:
  Epee M SD=80.1 vs F SD=45.1
  Foil M SD=55.7 vs F SD=37.0
  Saber M SD=51.5 vs F SD=39.2

TOP-N SEED SURVIVAL
--------------------
Top-8 recall (fraction of top-8 seeds finishing top-8):
  Foil:  52.4%
  Saber: 46.9%
  Epee:  31.2% — top seeds are most likely to get knocked out

Top-32 recall converges across weapons (~57-59%), suggesting the volatility
is concentrated at the top of the draw.

SYNTHESIS
---------
- Seeds are predictive but far from deterministic at the Div I level.
- Foil is consistently the most predictable weapon across all metrics.
- Saber is the least predictable by correlation; epee is the most volatile
  by upset distance and has the worst top-8 seed survival.
- Men's events are more volatile than women's, likely reflecting larger
  field sizes (more opportunities for upsets in early DE rounds).
- The weapon:gender interaction terms are not significant in regression,
  meaning the gender effect on predictability does not vary by weapon.
